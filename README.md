# Precompute

I have made a simple program to demonstrate how hashes can be pre-computed and stored in memory for faster password cracking. For the demonstration, I used the `Sha256` algorithm, but this method can work with other algorithms as well. However, it is important to note that as of right now, this method of cracking is very impractical since it would require exponential memory and computational usage for longer passwords.
