# Precompute

Made a simple program to demonstrate how hashes can be pre-computed and stored in memory for faster password cracking. For demonstration I used the Sha256 algorithm but this method can work with other algorithms too. As of right now this method of craking is very impractical since it would require exponential memory and computation usage for longer passwords.
